## User Stories <a name="userstories"></a>

* As a user, I want to see a list of all available kegs that show name, brand, price and alcoholContent. 
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
